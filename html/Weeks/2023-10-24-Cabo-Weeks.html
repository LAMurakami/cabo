I am a Fixed Weeks Timeshare Owner in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California, SUR Mexico. This used to be the most popular way to own a timeshare but there are many other options these days. The major industry of Cabo San Lucas is tourism and one of the ways to make the most from a tourist is to sell them a timeshare.  If you visit cabo you will be offered the opportunity to listen to a timeshare presentation.

<p>One of the best advantages of fixed weeks is that you can plan on that vacation on that date. I actually have fixed weeks with a particular room. I have to get there and if I have payed the annual maintenance fee, I check-in.
</p><p>Fixed weeks start on a particular day of the week and are numbered starting with the first of the year.

<li>In 2018, 14 years into the 21 year contract, I have yet to actually stay in my room.  I bank this week with RCI or do an internal trade with the resort to move it to a week next to week 8 and 9.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>The Ridge at Playa Grande D-3031 Master Suite (1 Bedroom, two bathrooms) Sunday Check-In Weeks 8 &amp; 9 through 2023
<ul><li>In 2017 the developers offered me a 1 bedroom unit at The Ridge at Playa Grande to get me out of the the last Solmar Beach Club Resort unit I had through 2023.  Although the new room is still weeks 8 &amp; 9 it is Sunday check-in and Check-out instead of Saturday.  I had been turning down many offers and finally accepted this new contract at no cost other than the increased maintenance fees.  When the Grand Solmar contract ends in 2018 I will no longer have any Solmar units and will only have Playa Grande units.</li></ul></li>
<li>Was: Solmar Beach Club Resort Weeks 8 &amp; 9 through 2023
<ul><li>In year 7 of the original 25 year contract I sent my mom and stepdad to Solmar for one of the two weeks.  They loved it so much that they contracted for 25 years of one of the original Solmar Hotel rooms.</li>
<li>In 2010 or 2011 they contracted for studio room 2482 (J482) of the Solmar Beach Club Resort to replace the remaining years of the Solmar Hotel rooms contract.  This room is in one of the buildings with elevator access to all floors.  They also made the switch from a Friday Check-in and Check-out to Saturday. By 2011 the Solmar Hotel and original lobby no longer exists.</li>
<li>In 2014 I bought the remaining weeks from my mom with the intention that she still vacation in Cabo for at least some of the years I also still have the Grand Solmar room.  Mom was in studio room 2482 (J182) of Solmar which became my second room for the same two weeks.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>I originally had a contract for 25 years on a 1 bedroom unit on the ground floor right next to the grand lobby and front pool bar of the original Solmar Hotel.  This unit and the Grand lobby of the original Solmar Hotel and Solmar Beach Club were destroyed in 2010 and 2011 along with all of the original Solmar Hotel to make way for the new  Grand Solmar.  My Grand Solmar room was on the 8th floor of the 11 story building standing where the original Solmar Hotel 2 story wing by the rocks was.  The room has a balcony facing the sunset and the beach in a building behind the main pool area with the entry doors facing the rocks.

<p>The above table represents weeks 8 and 9 from the original 1992 contract as well as the weeks for 8 &amp; 9 and 27 for additional contracts originally at Solmar.  The original contract was altered by the 2011 contract after the original room was destroyed by the developer of the Grand Solmar. On January 1, 2011 my original contract was still in effect but the room had either already been knocked down or was going to be knocked down before I arrived in February.  The replacement contract of the remaining seven years of the original 25 years did not start until 2012 because the new Grand Solmar was not yet ready.  I ended up staying at different rooms of the Solmar Beach Club available as "developer" rooms getting 25 years total.  I got what I considered the best room at the original Solmar Hotel and Solmar Beach Club only 17 years when I had contracted for 25.  The additional contracts by 2017 had all been converted to either Playa Grande Resort or The Ridge at Playa Grande contracts and in one case multiple conversions.
