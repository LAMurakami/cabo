<li>As of Tuesday, January 9, 2024 Both new contracts have been transferred to my name.
<ul><li>$4,000.00 = $1,333.33 / week for the 2024 Vacation</li>
<li>$3,500.00 / 16 = $218.75 / week for remaining 16 weeks of vacation paid in advance</li>
<li>$3,000.00 / 18 = $166.67 / week for remaining 18 weeks of vacation paid in advance</li>
<li>It currently costs an additional $89.00 to accelerate a week.</li>
<li>I owe Wendy a $5,500.00 check for the balance I intend to mail by the end of the month.  I want to schedule the first accelerated week use before mailing the final payment to Wendy.</li></ul></li>
<li>On Wednesday, January 3, 2024 I got a call from ResortCom at 702-263-9650 about an issue with the transfers.
<ul><li>The Week 10 &amp; 11 3124 (Ridge Building C) contract was transferred to me.</li>
<li>The week 9 1162 (Building B) contract was not transferred to me because there is an additional owner listed.</li>
<li>The representative was able to confirm that the contracts are through 2032 and 2042 but could not tell me about acceleration.</li>
<li>I called Wendy and let her know.  She said a nephew was added to the contract but didn't even know about it and she didn't think his signature was required.</li>
<li>I had written two $500.00 checks for the transfer but haven't yet paid the $5,500.00 balance.</li></ul></li>
<li>On Tuesday, December 19, 2023 I signed the paperwork for contracts 4 and 5 with Solmar.
<ul><li>I got the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z23/z2312/2023-12-19/Resort-Com-Transfer-Letter.pdf">transfer letter notarized</a> and mailed it with a copy of each of the contract transfer forms and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z23/z2312/2023-12-19/Resort-Com-Transfer-Checks.pdf">a check for $500.00 for each of the contracts</a>.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z23/z2312/2023-12-05/Playa-Grande-Transfer-02.pdf">Week 9 Room 1162</a> Account 790-24638 Contract 121701 $22,800 original price 8~? weeks remaining <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z23/z2312/2023-12-17/Playa-Grande-Transfer-02-New-Member.pdf">New-Member</a></li>

<li>It looks like Wendy is going forward with the transfer before a final payment from me.</li>
<li>I have now paid $5,000.00 for the 9, 10 &amp; 11 weeks from Wendy.  I believe the contracts may be through 2031 and 2041 based on 8 years including 2024 and another 10 for the week 9 unit.</li></ul></li>
<li>On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z23/z2310/2023-10-24/Daily-ak19.txt">Tuesday, October 24, 2023</a> Wendy now says her weeks are 9, 10 &amp; 11.
<ul><li>Saturday Week 9 1162 (Building B) and Saturday Week 9 &amp; 10 3124 (Ridge Building C) both a One Bedroom Master Suite on the second floor.</li>
<li>I got a $5,000.00 + $1,500.00 = $6,500 price for Wendy's week 9 through 2042 and weeks 10 &amp; 11 through 2032.  That's $203.13 / week for week 9 in 1162 through 2042 and weeks 10 &amp; 11 in 3124 through 2032.</li>
<li>I mailed a check to Wendy last week for $4,000.00 for her three weeks in 2024 which she texted me she got today.</li></ul></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z23/z2310/2023-10-11/Daily-ak19.txt">Wednesday, October 11, 2023</a> - Confirmed Wendy's weeks.
<ul><li>Saturday Week 8 2162 (Building B) and Saturday Week 9 &amp; 10 3124 (Ridge Building C) both a One Bedroom Master Suite on the second floor</li>
<li>Wendy indicated she and Mark are considering selling the rest of their Cabo weeks.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tuesday, March 7, 2023 - <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z23/z2306/2023-06-24/Wendy.jpg">Wendy</a> offers me three weeks in Cabo for 2024.
<ul><li>I had been telling my Cabo buddies that I had used up another 25 year contract and Wendy came over while Kathy was with me and offered up her three weeks in 2024 because they were planning a trip to Hawaii instead.</li>
<li>Wendy and her husband Mike have a week at the lower part of Playa Grande and two weeks on The Ridge at Playa Grande.</li>
<li>Wendy entered her contact information into my phone and I texted her a thank you.  I took a picture of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://z.lam1.us/Zz/z23/Wendy.jpg">contact entry</a>.</li>
<li>I have been seeing Wendy at the Ridge for years during our common week 10 &amp; 11 times.</li></ul></li>
<li>Saturday, November 12, 2022 - Created this page
<ul><li>I don't actually have a 2024 Cabo Vacation.  My Ridge weeks expired in 2023 and my Last Playa Grande week expires in 2024.  I did stay at the original Solmar Beach Club in 2022 for three weeks paying the per day rate.</li></ul></li></ul>
