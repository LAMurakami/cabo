I ended up doing four different three week vacations to Playa Grande and stayed at The Ridge all but the first time.  This was a total of over 12 weeks beating the over seven weeks previous record in 2017.
</p><p>The first 2021 Cabo Vacation was my first travel away from home since the 2020 Cabo Vacation a year before because of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  I have been going on this trip for more than 25 years and decided to plan for the 2021 trip even though I would probably not have done so during the COVID-19 pandemic if I did not already have the fixed week timeshare I love so much.  I had booked the vacation by November but included trip insurance in case I wanted to cancel the trip.  On Wednesday, January 6, 2021 I was able to schedule an appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and with both doses felt much safer about going on the trip.
</p><p>When I actually showed up at Playa Grande I was told The Ridge and the Solmar Beach Club were both closed and I stayed in ground floor rooms at the front of the resort.  The Ridge was closed as part of Solmar Resorts complying with capacity restrictions because of COVID-19.  At check in time I was told that Bonus weeks were also something Solmar Resorts was doing because of COVID-19.  I ended up doing three additional three week vacations in 2021 the last of which included an additional room for my brother and his wife.  They ended up being in suite 3101 next to 3102 which I had been in and possibly the best Master Suite at The Ridge.  Suite 3101 is the closest to the Adult Infinity Pool facing the Pacific at The Ridge.

<h2><span id="Log">Log</span></h2>
<ul><li>Monday, January 11, 2021 I saw an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z21/z2101/2021-01-11/Cabo-Itinerary.html">Alaska Airlines Cabo Itinerary</a> with slight changes from before.</li>
<li>Wednesday, January 6, 2021 - Today I was able to schedule an appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
<ul><li>My 2021 Cabo trip will be the first time I have travelled since returning from the 2020 Cabo vacation because of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  When I depart for Cabo I will have just completed the second of the two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.</li>
<li>When I scheduled the vacation I was hoping to be vaccinated before I travel but was considering the risk of going anyway.  I feel much better about the trip now.</li></ul></li>
<li>Thursday, December 3, 2020 - I got confirmation for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z20/z2012/2020-12-03/665604-Murakami.pdf">week 8</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z20/z2012/2020-12-03/665605-Murakami.pdf">week 9</a> in my Master Suite 3031 Ridge room.</li>
<li>Thursday, November 5, 2020 -  I exchanged Week 27 for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z20/z2011/2020-11-05/Playa-Grande-Week-10.pdf">Week 10</a> to add to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z20/z2012/2020-12-03/665604-Murakami.pdf">week 8</a> and week 9 Ridge stay $189.00.
<ul><li>I then added <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z20/z2011/2020-11-05/Solmar-Beach-Club.html">three nights at the Solmar Beach Club</a> for $563.23 and booked <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z20/z2011/2020-11-05/Cabo-Itinerary.html">a First Class Round Trip Ticket</a> with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak20.lam1.us/Zz/z20/z2011/2020-11-05/Allianz-trip-insurance.pdf">Trip Insurance</a> for $1,562.13.</li>
<li>I have been contemplating whether to plan for the Cabo trip in 2021 ever since returning on March 18 of 2020 when the US put out the COVID-19 international travel advisory.  Both Alaska and Cabo were in lock-down for a while over COVID-19 and both have reopened since.  In Alaska's case it is definitely worse now than before and I don't have that much information on Cabo but I don't expect either to completely lock-down again unless things get much worse.  The airfare is refundable and I sprang for trip insurance just in case.  I have been going on this trip for more than 25 years and have decided plan for the 2021 trip even though I would probably not do so during the COVID-19 pandemic if I did not already have the fixed week timeshare I love so much.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tuesday, October 13, 2020 @ 1:57:14 PM (Alaska Time) - Paid 2021 Maintenance Fees
<ul><li>Two separate payments were made each with a $4.95 fee for the two contracts for a $2,539.90 total for the three weeks.</li></ul></li>
<li>Monday, October 5, 2020 @ 7:03:36 PM (Alaska Time) - Solmar has reopened their resorts as of October 2020.
<ul><li>They were closed for months and they and are trying to get people to pay their Maintenance Fees by offering to waive the annual increase for 2021 if the fees are paid by October 15, 2020.  I paid $860.00 a week for the Ridge weeks and $810.00 for the Week 27 Playa Grande unit for a total of $2,530.00 in Maintenance Fees in 2020 for the three weeks.</li>
<li>The COVID-19 Pandemic is still going on and is as bad as ever in Fairbanks but travel to Mexico is allowed.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tuesday, May 19, 2020 @ 10:33:06 PM (Alaska Time) - I will not book my 2021 Cabo Vacation until I know more about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19</a>.
<ul><li>I took my <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cabo.lam1.us/Weeks/2020">2020 Cabo Vacation</a> as planned but heard more and more about COVID-19 as the vacation went on.</li>
<li>By the end of the vacation Cruise Ship passengers were not being allowed off the ships in the Cabo San Lucas port.</li>
<li>Within 24 hours after I returned to Alaska an International Travel Advisory was issued by the U.S.A. that would have required me to return.</li>
<li>I have been practicing Shelter In Place since my return although I am allowing myself to walk to the Post Office and check my mail without violating my version of the restrictions.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tuesday, May 1, 2018 @ 4:37:48 PM (Alaska Time) Created this page and linked it to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cabo.lam1.us/Weeks">cabo.lam1.us/Weeks</a>
<ul><li>I haven't done anything for 2021 so if I pay the maintenance fee I can show up for The Ridge at Playa Grande D-3031 Master Suite (1 Bedroom, two bathrooms) Sunday Check-In weeks 8 &amp; 9</li></ul></li></ul>
