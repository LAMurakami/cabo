<p>In 2017 I take my longest ever Cabo vacation of over six weeks.  The 2016 vacation was almost as long at six weeks and was the first since I retired.  About 2/3 of the way through the vacation I learn my house was burgled and truck stolen while I was away.  I continue the vacation and my stolen vehicle is recovered before I return.

<li>Wednesday, January 6, 2021 - It's been over three years since the burglary.
<ul><li>As a result of the burglary while I was on the 2017 Cabo vacation the aws.lam1.us server is a clone of the website on my main server (now ak20).</li>
<li>I still maintain my laptop as a clone (now ak19) as well as the old servers (ak17 and ak7).</li>
<li>I am still uneasy about leaving my house on vacation.</li>
<li>My 2021 Cabo trip will be the first time I have travelled since returning from the 2020 Cabo vacation because of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  When I depart for Cabo I will have just completed the second of the two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.</li></ul></li>
<li>Sunday, April 16, 2017 @ 2:01:46 PM  (Alaska Time) - I am back in Alaska after my vacation of almost seven weeks but not yet recovered from it.
<ul><li>While on vacation I had Internet access of varying service levels but have not yet recovered from the burglary on or before Tuesday, March 28, 2017.
<ul><li>My house does not yet have Internet access as the GCI Cable Modem was damaged as was my Wireless Access point and switch.  I have ordered a new Wireless Access Point and switch from Amazon.</li>
<li>ak16 can serve up the Cabo.lam1.us website even without Internet access and with Bk0 and Bk4 attached is my only server.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Tuesday, February 21, 2017 @ 12:54:43 PM (Alaska Time) - Today I finished up reservations for the 2017 Cabo trip.
<ul><li>I called Solmar reservations at 866-978-2578 and confirmed the Solmar and Play Grande internal trades and got the confirmation numbers:
<ul><li>Week 8 at Grand Solmar - Owner fixed week</li>
<li>Week 9 at Grand Solmar - Owner fixed week</li>
<li>Week 10 at Solmar - Internal Owner trade - Confirmation 361917 for 3/11/2017 check in date</li>
<li>Week 11 at Solmar - Internal Owner trade - Confirmation 361949 for 3/18/2017 check in date</li>
<li>Week 12 at Playa Grande - Internal Owner trade - Confirmation 526965 for 3/25/2017 check in date</li>
<li>Week 13 at Playa Grande - RCI Owner trade for 4/1/2017 check in date</li></ul></li>
<li>I called Mar de Cortez and made reservations for Sat, Sun, Mon, April 8-10, 2017</li>
<li>I used 17,500 miles and $57.81 for the return trip to Fairbanks on 4/11/2017
<ul><li>Depart SJD on Alaska 231 @ 2:41 pm - Arrive SEA 8:25 pm</li>
<li>Depart SEA on Alaska 127 @ 11:20 pm - Arrive FAI 1:58 am Next day arrival</li></ul></li>
<li>I called RCI and switched the search from one more 2017 week to a search for Check in date 17-Feb-2018 or 10-Mar-2018 to add to my 2018 vacation.</li></ul></li>
<li>Wednesday, January 4, 2017 @ 5:18:11 PM Alaska Time) - I got an email from RCI that a Playa Grande match came in.
<ul><li>I added Check in: 04/01/2017 16:00 Check out: 04/08/2017 11:00 to my 2017 Cabo vacation.</li>
<li>I started a new search for one more week with a check-in date of 4/8/2016.</li>
<li>I am up to a bit over six weeks with two weeks at the Grand Solmar, two weeks at Solmar, and then two weeks at Playa Grande preceded by a couple of days at the Mar De Cortez.</li></ul></li>
<li>Monday, January 2, 2017 @ 5:04:20 PM   (Alaska Time)
<ul><li><a href="/a/Z_2017_Juneau_ADP_SCC" title="Z 2017 Juneau ADP SCC">Z 2017 Juneau ADP SCC</a> January calendar now includes the Phoenix AZ DNC Forum I decided to fo to.</li></ul></li>
<li>Monday, December 19, 2016 @ 12:37:04 AM (Alaska Time) - I am up to 5 weeks and two days in Cabo and have a ticket to Cabo.
<ul><li>On Sunday 11/20/2016 Kathy decided to get my trip to Cabo using her Delta Miles.  She wanted to use the least miles so booked a trip for Thursday February 23, 2017 and I reserved two days at Mar De Cortez prior to the 5 resort weeks I have.  The trips are on Alaska Airlines but I got Delta Confirmation code GDY0SV and loaded the itinerary in my Delta App.  At Mar De Cortez I got a King in room 117 at the back on the right by the main pool.  A bit over a year ago they added a Breakfast at no additional charge.  I had a total of $151.32 charged to my Alaska Airlines VISA.  I got confirmation code 1878546.</li></ul></li>
<li>Thursday, October 27, 2016 @ 3:24:24 PM (Alaska Time) - I am up to 5 weeks in a row for 2017.
<ul><li>My brother said he has already bought his airline tickets in the email he forwarded about the maintenance fees and asked how we will handle it.
<ul><li>I will include a link to this page in my reply.</li></ul></li>
<li>I got weeks 10, 11 &amp; 12 for my 2017 weeks other than the Grand Solmar which I did not trade giving me weeks 8 through 12 in Cabo.</li>
<li>I will move from the Grand Solmar on Saturday March 11, 2017 after a two week stay for an additional two weeks in Cabo at the  Beach Club.</li>
<li>I will move from the Solmar Beach Club on Saturday March 25, 2017 to the Playa Grande for another week for a total of 5 weeks at the three resorts.
<ul><li>I accepted a studio at Playa Grande even though the trade I used would have qualified for a Master Suite.  It could be upgraded at a later date if a Master Suite become available.</li></ul></li>
<li>I have to modify the RCI searches for the new end dates of a week 7 or a week 13.</li>
<li>I have an additional RCI trade so could get as many as 7 weeks if the trades come through.</li>
<li>I have not yet purchased an Airline itinerary.</li>
<li>I could augment with some days at the Mar De Cortez to avoid Saturday travel.</li></ul></li>
<li>Wednesday, September 28, 2016 @ 4:45:47 PM (Alaska Time) - I paid 2017 Solmar Beach Club and Playa Grande fees.
<ul><li>I went online and paid $654.95 for the 2016 Playa Grande Resort Week 27 and $1,194.95 for the 2016 Solmar Beach Club Weeks 8 &amp; 9.  I did not pay the $1.504.95 for the 2016 Grand Solmar Land's End Resort E-6804 Master Suite.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tuesday, November 10, 2015 @ 4:02:07 PM (Alaska Time) - Yesterday I created this calendar and today I started a search for a week starting the 4th, 11th, 18th of February 2017 or 11th, 18th of March 2017.  I will use the 21 point Playa Grande week that is valid Jul-2014 - Jul-2017.  I already have a Cabo San Lucas 'No All-Inclusive' search going for 2016 but have not got a match in the month it has been going.  I asked about starting a search for 2018 ans was told a search is limited to two years from the start of the vacation.  I did not have to pay another $219.00 in advance to start the second search but will have to pay to keep it going once one of the searches comes up with a match I accept.</li>
