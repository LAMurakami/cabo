<p>In 2016 I moved the traded the Solmar weeks internally and got RCI trades for 2 of the Playa Grande weeks to end up with a Grand total of 6 weeks in a row at Cabo San Lucas.  The final week was obtained by an RCI trade while I was already in Cabo.  This week was a Spring Break week that I had started a search on to allow my niece to vacation in Cabo.  My sister was with me in Cabo when the search finally came up with a result so that she would be able to return with her daughter in a few week while I stayed in Cabo for that interim.  I had to return a day early to be able to lead the Democratic Caucus for my district in Alaska.  My sister and niece also returned early leaving a Resort day unused.

</li><li> Thursday, October 27, 2016 @ 11:39:20 AM (Alaska Time) - I noticed I had not updated this page to include the 6th. week.
<ul><li> The 6th. week was obtained while I was already on vacation.
</li><li> I had used twice the miles for a refundable itinerary and was able to switch it without additional miles.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Tuesday, February 2, 2016 @ 11:02:05 AM (Alaska Time) - I changed the flight reservation to 2/13/2016 from 2/6/2016 which was only days away.  I canceled the search for a week starting 2/6/2016 but left the search going for a week starting 3/19/2016 at the end.
</li><li> Published Page location: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cabo.lam1.us/Weeks/2016/February-March.html">http://cabo.lam1.us/Weeks/2016/February-March.html</a>
</li><li> Tuesday, January 26, 2016 @ 10:21:48 AM (Alaska Time) - I called RCI and talked to Ashanda who was able to switch the trade so that the 19 point unit used the 20 point exchange instead of the 29 point exchange.  She also added the week starting 3/19/2016 to the ongoing search now using the 29 point week.
<ul><li> I did not originally have the week starting the 19th. of March in my search because I have to be back in Alaska on the 26th. and don't like to leave a vacation unit unused.  My sister asked me to add it in because this is the Spring Break week for her daughter, my niece, who is in her first year of college.  If my sister and niece are there it is not an unused day!
</li><li> @ 10:28:50 PM (Alaska Time) - There are many Friday, February 12 and Saturday, February 13, 2016 Non-Refundable 35,000 mile itineraries.  It looks like way more than I remember so new ones get released at the less than three weeks left point?
</li></ul>
</li><li> Monday, January 25, 2016 @ 4:33:39 PM (Alaska Time) - RCI called me earlier and I declined to pay for an upgrade to RCI platinum.  I was told the limitations on exchanging to Cabo do not apply for an RCI trade back to my home resort.
<ul><li> I confirmed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak7.lam1.us/Zz/z16/z1601/2016-01-26/RCI-Playa-Grande.html">the Playa Grande week 11 exchange</a>.
</li><li> I authorized a charge of $229.00 (an increase of $10.00 since only a couple of months ago) for a new ongoing search for another week starting 2/6/2016.
</li><li> I changed the return part of my Airline itinerary so I now return on Saturday, March 19, 2016 and was able to get a good itinerary.
</li><li> I noted that there is only one good itinerary for the trip to Cabo on February 13, 2016 instead of the current February 6, 2016 itinerary.  There are still a couple of acceptable itineraries that leave late Friday just a couple of hours before the good itinerary.
</li><li> I will book when the options get a little slimmer (I only have a couple of weeks before I miss the current itinerary and three weeks before the one I need it I don't get the one more week.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Sunday, January 24, 2016 @ 9:26:16 AM (Alaska Time) - Yesterday I got an email that a Playa Grande room matched the search I started on 10/12/2015.  The match was for the week following the four I already have.
</li><li> Wednesday, December 30, 2015 @ 10:32:13 PM (Alaska Time) - Another couple of months have gone by and no luck with extra weeks.
<ul><li> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak7.lam1.us/Zz/z15/z1512/2015-12-30/Alaska-Airlines-FAI-SJD-03-Confirmed.html">I went ahead and booked a ticket</a> for departure on Saturday, February 6, 2016 counting on getting an extra week before the four I have.
</li><li> I booked the return for Saturday, March 12, 2016.
</li><li> I got good itineraries with only a change of planes in Seattle for both directions.
</li><li> I booked a refundable ticket in both directions for 35,000 miles each way using 70,000 of my 299,014 miles and $93.72 including taxes, fees and charges.
</li><li> I booked the earliest week in both directions giving me the most time before I would have to change the itinerary.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Saturday, September 26, 2015 @ 11:46:42 AM (Alaska Time) - Another week and still nothing but Mandatory All-Inclusive resorts.  I need to set up an ongoing search for specific resorts including Solmar and Playa Grande
<ul><li> I found Alaska Airlines round trip mileage award flights available for 35,000 miles avoiding Friday, Saturday and sometimes other days.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Saturday, September 19, 2015 @ 12:27:21 PM   (Alaska Time) - I have searched RCI a few times now and have only found Mandatory All-Inclusive resorts so far.  I am searching for:
<ul><li> 2/6/2016 - 2/13/2016 weeks and / or
</li><li> 3/12/2016 - 3/19/2016 weeks to wrap around the 2/13/2016 - 3/12/2016 I already have.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Friday, September 11, 2015 @ 9:10:07 PM (Alaska Time) - I got a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ak7.lam1.us/Zz/z15/z1509/2015-09-11/Solmar-Week-7.pdf">Solmar Week 7</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ak7.lam1.us/Zz/z15/z1509/2015-09-11/Solmar-Week-10.pdf">Solmar Week 10</a> to wrap around the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ak7.lam1.us/Zz/z15/z1509/2015-09-11/Grand-Solmar-Week-8.pdf">Grand Solmar Week 8</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ak7.lam1.us/Zz/z15/z1509/2015-09-11/Grand-Solmar-Week-9.pdf">Grand Solmar Week 9</a> by doing internal trades at Solmar.  I will look for another week using RCI.
