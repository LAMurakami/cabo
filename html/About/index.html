<br><p>I have vacationed at Cabo San Lucas,
 Baja California Sur, Mexico since 1993.  This site is a repository
 of some of my opinions, beliefs and knowledge of topics related to
 those vacations.

<br><br><p>I have returned so often because I bought timeshare weeks
 the first time I visited and returning is easier than vacationing
 somewhere else with those weeks.  My fixed weeks end up being at the
 end of February and the beginning of March each year which is a great
 time to leave Fairbanks, Alaska to vacation in Cabo.  Knowing that I
 get to vacation in Cabo helps me get through the worst part of winter.
 This year (2008) we had 10 days in a row with temperatures colder than
 -40 Fairenheit (this is the temperature that is the same in Celsius)
 in the beginning of February and counting days till Cabo helped me get
 though it.
